<p> certification projects I did.
<p> I wrote all this stuff using the compiler found on the freecodecamp website and copied them over. 
<p> As much as possible, I limited my use of AI to explaining some smaller concepts and specifically instructed the AI to not write any code for me at all. 
<p> I discovered much of my troubleshooting on websites like stackoverflow and geeksforgeeks.
<p> This is also my first repo on github and I'm not too sure how things work very well. I'm sure I'll update the formatting some day :)
